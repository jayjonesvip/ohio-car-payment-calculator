## Ohio Tax Law Notes

### Important Ohio-Specific Rules
1. **New Vehicle Trade-In Credit**: When buying a new vehicle, the trade-in value is subtracted from the purchase price BEFORE calculating sales tax.

2. **Used Vehicle Trade-In**: Used vehicle purchases do NOT receive a trade-in tax credit. You pay sales tax on the full purchase price.

3. **Negative Equity**: If you owe more on your trade-in than it's worth, the difference (negative equity) IS added to the taxable base.

4. **Documentation Fees**: Currently non-taxable in Ohio (as of 2025).

5. **County Variations**: Ohio sales tax rates vary by county. Common rates:
   - Cuyahoga County: 8.00%
   - Franklin County: 7.50%
   - Hamilton County: 7.80%
   - Most counties: 7.25% - 8.25%

## Calculation Methods

### Monthly Payment Formula
```
Standard Amortization:
Payment = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Principal (amount financed)
r = Monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
n = Number of payments (term in months)
```

### Compound Interest Formula
```
Future Value = P × (1 + r)^n

Where:
P = Principal invested
r = Monthly rate
n = Number of months
```

### Annuity Formula (Monthly Investing)
```
FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

Where:
PMT = Monthly payment
r = Monthly rate
n = Number of months
```
